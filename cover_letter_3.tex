Are you searching for a software engineer with the ability to build scalable software systems with the passion for technologies, a right attitude to learning and technical innovations? If so, please consider my enclosed resume.

A year of working as a software engineer at ClassCom has taught many aspects about building impactful and scalable systems. The type of skills which will make me the right candidate for your organisation. Those skills include but are not limited to high proficiency of Java, Python and Javascript, understanding practical applications of algorithms and data structures, implementing and design high-performing relational and non-relational database with SQL and MongoDB, Object Oriented Design Patterns and Principles. Prior to experience my training in Computer Science and Mathematics helped me to lay a strong foundation which enable live-long learning and the ability to cope with technological changes in a fast paced environment.
 
These past journeys have not only equipped with the right technical skills but also some of valuable interpersonal skills. The opportunities to work within a diverse set of teams have taught me about self-management and time-management. Furthermore, Collaborative Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution skills were often challenged and pushed improved as a result of these experience. Working with both remote and local teams have taught me how to communicate effectively using writtern and verbal means. These are the type of skills which I believe your organisation will find valuable.

Other than this, my commitment to excellence which is proven by the Wyselaskie Scholarship in Logic and various other accomplishment makes me believe that I am a right fit for your organisation.
